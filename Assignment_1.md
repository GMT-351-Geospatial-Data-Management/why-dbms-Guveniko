Quesiton 1

To compare E-Table and Database:
While writing the desired type (int, string, etc.) to the desired cell in Spreadsheet, the specified type of data should be written to each cell in the database. 

While you can make calculations by writing formulas while filling the data in Spreadsheet, there is no such situation in the database.

When the data is updated in Spreadsheet, the data is updated only on the computer where it is located, while a data updated in the database is valid for everyone.

Spreadsheet is an application that allows the user to work on a spreadsheet similar to an accounting worksheet whereas a database is designed to easily organize, store and retrieve large amounts of data.

While there is a data limit in spreadsheets, such a limitation is not encountered in a database.
